# VPS Service

**VPS(Virtual Private Server)** provides alternative computational resources which could be much faster than desktop PC, therefore it can be used for compute-intensive tasks.

This section provides a tutorial to access VPS service hosted on lab server.

## Apply for account

Firstly, ask the administrator for a user account, including the host and port information of the VPS.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure that newer stable versions of the softwares listed below have been installed(depend on the OS of your desktop):

- Windows

    * [Putty](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe)
- MacOS
    * [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)
- Linux
    * [Batteries Included](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batteries_Included_(slang))

Note that Putty is self-contained portable software, you can run it directly without manual installation.

## Get started

### MacOS

Start **XQuartz** from Launchpad, then open built-in terminal of OS X, input

```bash
ssh -X -p [port] [username]@[hostname]
``` 

to connect to the server.

### Linux

Familiar with MacOS, open terminal and input

```bash
ssh -X -p [port] [username]@[hostname]
``` 

to connect to the server.

## User-friendly Shell

### Use zsh as default shell

The default terminal interface may be ugly since some of the fonts required is not installed on your OS, nevertheless you can switch to a more user-friendly command line interface, which can be done by following commands listed below:

Login into your terminal, input

```bash
mkdir .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/OnceMore2020/OnceDot.git
cd OnceDot
python install.py
```

when you see the message below, input `1,2` then hit ENTER.

the script may ask you to input your password to finish the configuration.

When the script quits without error, logout by typing `exit` in the terminal, and re-login to your user account.

### Source Code Pro

Some fonts are designed to be more compatible with command line, *Adobe Source Code Pro* is one of them, and is recommended to be used as the default font of your terminal user interface.

![scp](../media/scp.png)

Download latest release of [Adobe Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro/releases) and install the **Regular** font.

Change the font of your terminal to Source Code Pro, for example, using Putty, go to the submenu - **Window \| Appearance** and change to font to Source Code Pro.
